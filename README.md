# Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

After completing the initial steps of the application I was able to make the following observations:

The first observation on bar acceptance rate was that people that already went to a bar more than 3 times a month accepted the coupon at a higher rate
The second observation is people that did not have underage passengers and were not widowed had the largest variance between accepting and not accepting the coupon

# Based on these main observations, it is clear bar frequency and age are the primary deciding factors on whether someone will accept the coupon

For my independent investigation I used the Carry Out data. Using the same methods to process the Bar data, I observed the acceptance rate of drivers under the age of 30 that carried out more than once a month and also drivers that had under age passengers and carried out more than once a month. 

Acceptance rate for drivers who carry out more than once a month and were under 30: 0.73
Acceptance rate for all other drivers: 0.74
Difference in acceptance rates: -0.01

Acceptance rate for drivers who carry out more than once a month, had passengers that were kids: 0.73
Acceptance rate for all other drivers: 0.80
Difference in acceptance rates: -0.06

In the first case, all other drivers actually exceeded the under 30 drivers indicating the older we get, the more take-out we eat! I can confirm that to be accurate. The second case yielded also yielded interesting results. I assumed when working on it that drivers with children passengers would far exceed all others in accepting a carry out coupon but that was also not the case. All other drivers exceeded drivers with kids indicating to me that if you are driving alone or with adults, you have more flexibility to alter course and get carry out.
